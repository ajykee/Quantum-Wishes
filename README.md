# ✨ Quantum Wishes

**A Probabilistic Blockchain Lottery Where Community Participation Fuels Destiny**

---

## 🌀 Overview

**Quantum Wishes** is a decentralized, gamified lottery system that rewards users based on **probability**, **karma**, and **community involvement**. Participants use **quantum energy tokens** to create, support, and fulfill "wishes" — blockchain-based goals that evolve probabilistically. The more support a wish receives, the more likely it is to be granted.

---

## 🚀 Key Concepts

* **Wishes**: User-created goals with set targets, durations, and optional beneficiaries.
* **Quantum Energy**: A fungible token used to fuel wish creation and boosting.
* **Granted Wishes**: NFT trophies minted when wishes are fulfilled.
* **Probability System**: Community-driven mechanics increase the odds of success.
* **Karma & Luck**: User attributes that evolve over time and impact gameplay.
* **Quantum Bonds**: Social links formed by supporting others' wishes.
* **Events & Entanglement**: Temporal and relational mechanics that shape outcomes.

## 🔧 Key Functions

### 🎁 Create & Manage Wishes

* `create-wish(wish-type, description, target-amount, duration, beneficiary)`
* `support-wish(wish-id, amount, energy-boost, message)`
* `attempt-wish-fulfillment(wish-id)`
* `entangle-wishes(wish-id-1, wish-id-2)` – links two wishes for shared probability boost

### 🪙 Quantum Energy Management

* `claim-daily-energy()` – based on luck & karma
* `generate-quantum-energy-burst()` – rewards for granted wishes

### 📊 System Events

* `create-probability-event(event-type, multiplier, duration, description)`

### 🛠 Admin Controls

* Only `contract-owner` can launch probability events.

## 🧠 Mechanics

### ⚗️ Probability Calculation

Wishes have a base probability influenced by:

* Karma and luck of the wisher
* STX contributions
* Quantum energy boosts
* Number of supporters
* Global community multiplier (via events)

### 💖 Quantum Bonds

Supporting someone’s wish forms a **bond** that strengthens over time, increasing shared wish potential and encouraging positive feedback loops.

### 🎇 NFT Rewards

When a wish is fulfilled:

* A **`granted-wish` NFT** is minted
* STX funds are transferred to the beneficiary
* Karma and luck values are adjusted
* A **quantum energy burst** may occur

---

## 📈 Profiles & Progression

Each user has a profile with the following metrics:

* **total-wishes**
* **wishes-granted**
* **wishes-supported**
* **karma-points**
* **luck-factor**
* **quantum-energy-generated**

Daily actions like `claim-daily-energy` or supporting others build a richer gameplay experience.

## 🧪 Example Workflow

1. **Alice** claims daily quantum energy.
2. She **creates a "community" wish** to plant 100 trees in her town.
3. **Bob and Carol** support her wish with STX and energy boosts.
4. As support grows, **probability increases**.
5. A community event is triggered: `"Earth Week"` with +50% multiplier.
6. **Wish is fulfilled!** STX is sent to the beneficiary, and all contributors gain karma. Alice receives a `granted-wish` NFT.
